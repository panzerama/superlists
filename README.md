##Superlists - a tutorial app

I created this app as part of a tutorial on test driven development by [Harry Percival](https://github.com/hjwp), ["Test Driven Development with Python"](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/) Published by O'Reilly media. I'd highly recommend it both as an intro to tdd and a fun project for someone new to deploying a Django app to a server.
