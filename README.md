####a tutorial app using Python and Django

I created this app as part of a tutorial on test driven development by [Harry Percival](https://github.com/hjwp), ["Test Driven Development with Python"](http://www.obeythetestinggoat.com/) Published by O'Reilly media. I'd highly recommend it both as an intro to tdd and a fun project for someone new to developing a Django app.
